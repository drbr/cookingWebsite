  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 recipe Béchamel Sauce (see above)
    * 1 lb pasta; macaroni, shells, cavatappi, fusilli, or similar shape
    * 1 to 1 1/2 lbs grated cheese, of any assortment.
      My signature blend is 1/3 cheddar, 1/3 gruyère, 1/3 bleu.
    * Mix-ins of choice, if desired (for example: meat, diced peppers, etc.)
    * 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs

    1. Preheat oven to 350 °F. Ready the ramekins or a large baking dish.
    2. Start boiling some water to cook the pasta. When water is ready, cook pasta
       according to package directions, just shy of al dente.
    3. In parallel, make the béchamel sauce.
    4. Once sauce has thickened, stir cheese into sauce until completely melted. This is now a Mornay sauce.
    5. Drain pasta and transfer to baking dish. Pour Mornay sauce over pasta, add any mix-ins, and combine.
    6. Sprinkle the top with the breadcrumbs.
    7. Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 °F, until the sauce is bubbling up from the sides.
    8. Finish under the broiler until the top becomes golden brown (<5 minutes). Do not let it burn!
    9. Let cool before serving. Or not.

This recipe won 4th place out of 8 in my friends' Mac and Cheese contest!
That may not sound so impressive, but my friends are really good cooks.

Like many macaroni and cheese recipes, this one is based on a [Béchamel Sauce]({% post_url 2012-05-12-bechamel-sauce %}).
