Baba Ghanouj is a traditional Arabic appetizer, essentially the same thing as hummus but with eggplant instead of chickpeas. Pre-grilled eggplant in a jar can be found at Arab grocery stores, and if this is used, the baba ghanouj can be assembled in mere minutes.

Tahini imparts a rich nutty flavor to the dish. I use a lot more of it than many other recipes, and I think it's an essential component of the taste. **Don't skimp!** The recipe says "1 cup", but I really just pour a bunch in until it looks like there's enough to smooth out the eggplant.

**A note about tahini:** The consistency of tahini can vary widely by brand. The only brand I've been disappointed with is Trader Joe's; it's much too thick. My family uses the "Al Kanater" brand with the distinctive orange lid (pictured below), which can be found at Arab grocery stores, although any of the brands found at an Arab store should work equally well. The dense solids settle to the bottom of the jar in storage, so the tahini should be mixed well before pouring.
