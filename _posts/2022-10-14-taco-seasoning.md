    1. Find a spice jar that's slightly bigger than the amount of seasoning you're planning to make.
       It should have a tight-fitting lid. I make a double batch (1 ½ cups) and use a 2-cup jar.
    2. Measure all the ingredients into the jar.
    3. Screw on the lid and shake the jar until well blended.

Nothing fancy here; this is a good substitute for the stuff in the packet. Make a big batch and keep
it around and toss a couple heaping spoonfuls onto your ground beef.
