    * 1 eggplant, chopped
    * 2 Tbsp olive oil
    * 1 lb. ziti
    * 24 oz jar marinara sauce
    * 1 cup part-skim ricotta

    1. Preheat the oven to 400 °F.
    1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet and add the eggplant with a couple pinches of salt and
    pepper. Saute for about 20 minutes, until very soft and darkened.
    1. Put the uncooked ziti, sauce, ricotta, raw spinach, eggplant, and Aleppo pepper in a large
    baking pan. Mix thoroughly.
    1. Add just enough water to cover, along with the ½ tsp salt. This water will cook the pasta as
    the dish bakes.
    1. Bake at 400 °F for 45 minutes, until most of the water has evaporated.
    1. Add a layer of mozzarella to the top and return to the oven.
    1. Continue to bake another 15-20 minutes until it is done.

This is a draft of low-prep Baked Ziti.

The eggplant is meant to give a meat-like flavor to the vegetarian dish. A
variation could be to skip the eggplant and use bolognese sauce instead.
