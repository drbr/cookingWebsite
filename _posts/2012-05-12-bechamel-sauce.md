    * 5 Tbsp butter

    1. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium-low heat until melted. Add the flour and stir until smooth. This process makes a roux.
    2. Over medium heat, cook until the mixture turns a light, golden sandy color, about 5 minutes.
    3. Simultaneously, in a separate pan, heat milk just until it starts to boil.
    4. Add the hot milk to the butter mixture, one cup at a time. Bring back to a boil.
    5. Continue stirring for about 10 minutes on medium heat (the sauce will become quite thick).
    6. Season with the salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
    7. If making a Mornay sauce, add the cheese and continue to stir until melted.
    8. Remove from heat and let sit until ready to serve.

A core component of my [Macaroni and Cheese]({% post_url 2012-05-12-macaroni-and-cheese %}), the recipe for this sauce was given to me by my brother, Richard Brandon.

Richard provides the following note along with his recipe:

> *Also known as white sauce, Béchamel is one of the mother sauces of French cuisine and is also used in many recipes of Italian cuisine.
> According to [Larousse Gastronomique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larousse_Gastronomique), the sauce is named after the "marquis de Béchamel".
> Many other sauces can be made by expanding this recipe.
> Grated cheese added brings us a Mornay sauce.
> Cooking shrimp shells in the heated milk offers extra flavor to shrimp pasta.
> Partial chicken or fish stock can be substituted for the milk.*
