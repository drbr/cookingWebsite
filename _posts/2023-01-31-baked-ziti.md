recipe:
  servings: 6 generous servings
  prep: 5 minutes
  cook: 1 hour
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 lb. ziti, or other dry pasta (_not fresh pasta_)
    * 24 oz jar marinara sauce
    * 1 cup part-skim ricotta
    * 1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, because I like it a bit spicy)
    * 1 lb. part-skim mozzarella cheese, grated
    * 3 cups water
    * ¾ tsp salt

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat the oven to 400 °F.
    1. Put the uncooked ziti, sauce, ricotta, and pepper flakes in a 9x13 baking pan. Mix thoroughly.
    1. Pour in just enough water to cover (about 3 cups), along with the ¾ tsp salt. This water will
    cook the pasta as the dish bakes.
    1. Bake at 400 °F for 45 minutes, until most of the water has evaporated.
    1. Cover the top with the mozzarella and return to the oven.
    1. Continue to bake another 15-20 minutes until it is done.

This recipe is still something of a draft. Next time I make it I'll take a picture.

I recently learned that it's possible to make baked pasta dishes without boiling the pasta first.
Instead, just add the dry pasta to the baking dish with extra water and salt, and that water will
cook the pasta as the whole thing bakes. I tried it once, and it works! So, here's a recipe for
minimal-prep baked ziti.

Possible variations:

- Add a bunch of raw baby spinach. No need to sauté first, just stick it in there. But maybe
  sautéeing is helpful so the greens wilt a little, otherwise it's hard to stir them in.
- Chop two eggplants and sauté them in olive oil and salt for 20 minutes until they're dark and soft.
  Mix it in with the rest of the ingredients before baking.
- For a meaty ziti, use bolognese sauce instead of marinara.
- Use other pasta shapes according to your whims.<br/>
  _Note: I have not tried this technique on
  fresh/raw pasta; it likely won't work because of the chemical differences. Please tweet at me if
  you have info on this!_
