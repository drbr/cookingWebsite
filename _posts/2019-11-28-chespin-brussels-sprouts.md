    1. Combine the brussels sprouts, salt, and oil in a 9×13 pan. Roast at 375 °F until fragrant (approx. 45 minutes), stirring partway through.
    2. Meanwhile, sauté the apples in the butter until soft. Then, add the fennel seeds and chestnuts and sauté for a few minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in the heavy cream.
    3. Add the brussels sprouts into the apple mixture and combine. Drain excess liquid from the 9×13 baking pan, then move the entire mixture back into the baking pan and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the brussels sprouts are soft.

For those not up to date on the latest video game trends, Chespin is the name of a chestnut-themed Pokémon. I owe this recipe to my friend Nate Buck, enthusiast of video games and gastronomy.
Nate created this recipe using his knowledge of Pokémon along with [The Flavor Bible](http://www.theflavorbible.com/). It was such a big hit at his Pokémon-themed dinner party that I decided to add it to my repertoire as well. I've adjusted the recipe slightly, which is how it's presented here.
