    * 2 parts tahini
    * 1 part lemon juice (fresh squeezed preferred)
    * 1 part Greek yogurt (optional)
    * Salt
    * Water

    1. Mix the tahini in the jar to re√Øncorporate the solids that have settled to the bottom.
    2. Pour some tahini into a mixing bowl. The recipe says "2 parts" but I just eyeball it.
    3. Add lemon juice, the optional yogurt, and a dash of salt.

        If you want a creamier sauce, yogurt can be a good addition; if you want a runny sauce, leave it out.

    4. Mix it all together with a rubber bowl scraper. Check for taste. It likely needs more lemon and/or salt. Adjust ingredients for taste as necessary.

    5. Once the taste is dialed in, thin the sauce by adding water, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.

This sauce is so simple it doesn't really lend itself to a formal recipe, but I still have to tell you how to make it somehow and this blog template formats every page as a recipe whether I like it or not.

Tahini sauce is an all-purpose garnish, which imparts a rich creaminess to whatever it adorns. One of my go-to meals is the "Drbr Tahini Special", which consists of various roasted vegetables served with rice and topped with giant dollops of this sauce.

You can also make a thin version (by adding more water), which can be drizzled on a wide variety of foods (such as [lamb stew]({% post_url 2020-03-26-lamb-stew %})).

**A note about tahini:** The consistency of tahini can vary widely by brand. The only brand I've been disappointed with is Trader Joe's; it's much too thick. My family uses the "Al Kanater" brand with the distinctive orange lid, which can be found at Arab grocery stores, although any of the brands found at an Arab store should work equally well. The dense solids settle to the bottom of the jar in storage, so the tahini should be mixed well before pouring.
