    * Extra virgin olive oil

    1. Chop the tomatoes and cucumbers and put into a big bowl.
    2. Mince the shallot, jalapeño/serrano pepper, and mint, and add to the bowl.
       These are for flavor, not for texture.
    3. Dress to taste with the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and mix to coat. The
       dressing should be fairly lemony, but not too much, as the lemon taste will get stronger as
       the salad sits.
    4. Eat immediately, or refrigerate for later; the flavor will improve as the dressing permeates
       the salad.

Outside of the Middle East, this salad is known by various names, most often
"[Israeli Salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_salad)", but because I'm
Palestinian I call it "Palestinian Salad".

It's very simple to make, and a good choice for a hot sunny day! As with most
ubiquitous dishes, there's no single authoritative recipe. I've included some
suggested ingredient swaps below; make it with what you have on hand!

It can be eaten a myriad of ways. Some serving ideas:

- Serve as a side to any other dish
- Use as a filler for pita sandwiches
- Garnish with sumac or [tahini sauce]({% post_url 2020-03-26-tahini-sauce%})
- Eat the whole batch on its own straight from the bowl, like I just did
